In early 2006, an 80’s band called Great Scott! was formed as a project focused mainly on playing signature songs of artists who were popular in the 80’s. Bands like Police, Duran Duran, Heart, Tears for Fears, and Blondie. Performers like Peter Gabriel, Pat Benatar, Thomas Dolby, and Joan Jett. In early 2010, with a new drummer and a new name, Denim Arcade was born.
<p>
The band grew out of an original progressive rock band called Noise Dot Com, coupled with the drummer from a progressive band called Trilobite Café and the Ren Rock band The Lost Boys, and the female lead singer from the Indie band, Karma Lingo. They honed their skills at playing some of the most recognizable and fun songs from the 80’s, using similar equipment to what was employed during this period. They stuck to the belief that if a band is going to play tunes from a certain era – and expect to actually sound like the real thing – they needed to invest in equipment that would produce the same sound with the same quality as the bands from that period. 
<p>
Wade studied guitar and music production in college. He has been playing in groups in Florida and the Atlanta area since the age of 15. John met Wade when both were playing in Noise Dot Com. John has been laying down the bass for bands in South Carolina and Georgia for almost 25 years. Becky has been performing on stages in various venues around Atlanta and Washington, D.C. for over 15 years. She obtained a degree in performance including voice, dance and acting as well as music theory. Andy has been playing drums for more than twenty years and been in a wide variety of bands, including Atlanta-based renaissance festival phenom The Lost Boys. He has recorded drum set on five CDs, most recently his own solo CD- Greatest Hits Volume 27- upon which he sang and played most of the instrumental tracks.
<p>
The voices of the lead singers sound remarkably like the vocals you have listened to on the original recordings. You will hear the same sound, the same energy and the same quality performance you might have experienced if you were attending a live concert in 1989. There are times you’ll swear you’re listening to the actual artists.
